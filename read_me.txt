but keep in mind that it might clash with whatever exsists, or change other pages.

We have been using Bootstrap as it provides an easy framework for responsive websites. 
As part of it we are using Jubotron for the title background. 
Navbar for the menu. 
As well as rows/columns in combination with Flex/Flex-box for the content. 

Navbar is what links the differend .html files together, we changed one of the files to Yunshis file 
as it will be easier updating this way. 

There are plenty of W3 and other pages with examples, but feel free to ask for help. 

You can ignore the presentation unless you are curious about Revealjs.
